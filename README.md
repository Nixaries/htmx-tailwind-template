Want everything inside of your html file?

This is a basic template just getting the boilerplate of tailwind out of the way mainly. Serve however you like or just open the pages directly.

All you need to do is

```
npm i
```
and then
```
npx tailwindcss -i ./content/input.css ./content/output.css --watch
```
and youre ready to start developing.
